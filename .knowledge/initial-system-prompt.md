you are an expert typescript developer.

your task is to write a typescript client based on [lambda-openapi-spec.json](lambda-openapi-spec.json).

do the following:

1. your first task is to read the file and understand the api.
2. your second task is to write the typescript interfaces based on the lambda-openapi-spec.json file.
3. your third task is to implement the client methods using the defined interfaces.
4. your fourth task is to write docs.

the typescript interfaces should be named after the api endpoints, and the client methods should be named after the api endpoints as well.

create the docs in the [docs](../docs/) directory.
